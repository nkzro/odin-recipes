    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1¼ cups chopped dark chocolate</li>
        <li>½ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>½ cup teff flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon teff flour</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8-inch square baking dish.</li>
        <li>Combine chocolate and butter in top of a double boiler over simmering water. Stir frequently, scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching, until chocolate is melted, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Whisk 1 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar and vanilla extract into melted chocolate mixture. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Sift 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon teff flour and cocoa powder over mixture and mix well until all ingredients are incorporated into a smooth batter. Pour batter into prepared baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a skewer inserted into centre of brownies comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Allow to cool for 10 minutes before slicing into squares.</li>
    </ol>
