    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        I'm gonna show you how to make the world's most famous tuna sandwich, which is really the world's most famous tuna salad, the Niçoise, stuffed and pressed inside a whole loaf of bread. According to people who consider things, this is considered the ultimate picnic sandwich, since it has to be made ahead, and the longer it sits in its own juices, the better.delicious.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>⅓ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1 loaf day-old crusty French bread, split in half lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 medium ripe tomatoes, sliced, divided</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt to taste</li>
        <li>⅓ cup thinly sliced red onion</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sliced green olives</li>
        <li>⅓ cup sliced black olives</li>
        <li>½ cup thinly sliced banana peppers</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups olive oil-packed tuna, broken into large chunks</li>
        <li>8 oil-packed anchovy fillets</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon drained capers</li>
        <li>2 medium hard-boiled eggs, sliced</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh basil leaves, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Stir garlic into the olive oil and set aside.</li>
        <li>Partially hollow out the bread by pulling out about 50% of the insides. Brush the bread very generously with the garlic olive oil, reserving about 1 tablespoon for later use.</li>
        <li>Begin building the sandwich by placing a layer of sliced tomatoes on the bottom half, covering it completely. Season with salt and pepper. Top with sliced onion, olives, and banana peppers.</li>
        <li>Crumble the tuna over the top, pressing down slightly so it stays in place. Be sure to go as close to the edges as possible. Top with anchovy filets, capers, sliced eggs, and basil leaves. Top with another layer of tomatoes. Season with salt and pepper. Drizzle with vinegar and reserved garlic olive oil.</li>
        <li>Place the top half of the loaf on and press firmly to compress the ingredients. Wrap in several layers of plastic wrap, then with aluminum foil, ending with seams at the top.</li>
        <li>Place into a large pan and place a sheet pan over the top. Weigh down with heavy cans, pots, a cast iron pan, or a cutting board, to press the sandwich as evenly as possible.</li>
